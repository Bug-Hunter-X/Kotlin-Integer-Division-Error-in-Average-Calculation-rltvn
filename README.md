This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin involving integer division that leads to an inaccurate average calculation. The bug is caused by performing division between integers, which truncates the decimal portion of the result. The solution shows how to resolve this issue by explicitly casting the integer values to doubles before performing the division. This ensures that the calculation is done with floating-point precision and produces the correct average. This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in arithmetic operations to avoid unexpected results.
